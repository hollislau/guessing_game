        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
          <p>The computer opponent, Sheldon, challenges the player to a game of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.<br />The player is asked for a name and is then prompted to select from the five available choices: rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or Spock.<br />A random selection is made for Sheldon.  Based on the selections, a winner for the match is determined as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scissors cuts paper</li>
            <li>Paper covers rock</li>
            <li>Rock crushes lizard</li>
            <li>Lizard poisons Spock</li>
            <li>Spock smashes scissors</li>
            <li>Scissors decapitates lizard</li>
            <li>Lizard eats paper</li>
            <li>Paper disproves Spock</li>
            <li>Spock vaporizes rock</li>
            <li>(and as it always has) Rock crushes scissors</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Following the match, the player may play again as often as desired, and the number of matches and victories earned by Sheldon and the player are tracked.</p>

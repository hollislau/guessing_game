        <li>Rock crushes lizard</li>
        <li>Lizard poisons Spock</li>
        <li>Spock smashes scissors</li>
        <li>Scissors decapitates lizard</li>
        <li>Lizard eats paper</li>
        <li>Paper disproves Spock</li>
        <li>Spock vaporizes rock</li>
        <li>(and as it always has) Rock crushes scissors</li>
